FirmwareUploader
==============
&copy; 2010  |  [ruby.gruena.net][gruena]


Why ?
------

Do you have computer hardware (printers ...) with no firmware inside ?

These devices needs their firmware each time you switch on.

But if you use this hardware on special "boxes" (router, printserver ...) you can have problems.


**Example:**

Printer: *HP LaserJet P1005* (no internal firmware) 

=> [HP product page][HPLJP1005]

* you have to load the firmware after switching on
* you have problems when the printer is not connected directly to your
   machine / connected to printer server (samba, cups etc.)

Function
---------
Upload your firmware to printers etc. over TCP/IP

   
Usage
------

**Configuration** for FirmwareUploader inside "config.txt"

<table border="1">
  <tr>
      <td><b>server</b></td>
      <td>IP address / host name of server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td><b>port</b></td>
      <td>Port number of server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td><b>file</b></td>
      <td>Firmware file name *)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*) for example: "sihpP1005.dl" (for HP LJ P1005)

**Start**

Installation (setup) of FirmwareUploader places a link inside windows autostart folder => automatic startup when windows start

"upload.exe" looks inside your configuration and transmit the firmware file to server.
